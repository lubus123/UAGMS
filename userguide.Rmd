## Can I use my own data instead of the preloaded database (default)?

You can upload your own datasource by navigating to the 'Data Configuration Tab' on the left hand side, and uploading it in a .csv format. You can choose individual files for Entry/Exit Shrinkage.

It must be formated with column names in the first row, and the first column must contain the date in the format "%d/%m/%Y", as seen below. You can then use the app as normal.

Note: Uploading custom .csv for entry or exit will disable some of the relational functionality.
