# FAQ

## Can I use my own data instead of the preloaded database (default)?

You can upload your own datasource by navigating to the 'Data Configuration Tab' on the left hand side, and uploading it in a .csv format. You can choose individual files for Entry/Exit Shrinkage.

It must be formated with column names in the first row, and the first column must contain the date in the format "%d/%m/%Y", as seen below. You can then use the app as normal.

Note: Uploading custom .csv for entry or exit will disable some of the relational functionality.

## How can I download the results of my analysis 

There are 2 pathways to follow when you want to download results. The reporting tab allows you to select modules to include in a report, and then runs the analysis using the options selected in-app and collates this in a .pdf format. 

The results of a batch analysis of an interval of individual days (returning the flagged nodes for each) can be downloaded in the Day Explorer. Note that you need to select the range in the UAG monitor tab. 

## The changepoint analysis looks supsicious - I expect to find some changes in my data!

Whilst the changepoint models use default statistically sound parameters for the significance testing, scenarios may arise where an estimate of a known change is required; this can be achieved by lowering the significance thresholds. Whilst these differe according to algorithm, these controls have been provided in the form of sliders in the changepoint tab. As we canot specify a required number of changepoints when using the PELT procedure, you must select 'BinSeg' to be able to change the significance levels for that algorithm.
